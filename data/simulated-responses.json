However, I have a feature request that would make our workflow much more efficient.\n\nWould it be possible to add a bulk export feature that allows us to export all our data to CSV format? Currently, we have to export each record individually which is quite time-consuming when dealing with hundreds of entries.\n\nThis would be incredibly helpful for our monthly reporting process. I'd also love to see the option to schedule automated exports if that's something you're considering.\n\nThanks for building such a great product! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\nSarah Johnson\nOperations Manager",
